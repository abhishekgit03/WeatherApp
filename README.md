# Weather App
Get to know the weather status of any location around the world.

## Description
I have build a dynamic weather website using just HTML,CSS and Javascript where you can search weather status of any city around the world. The results will be shown precisely inside a box that includes fields for:
* Weather(Clouds/Rain/Snow/Mist/Haze)
* Temperature 
* Humidity
* Wind Speed

The application uses OpenWeather API for fetching real time data and insights about the weather of a particular location.
Besides it also shows some animation on the background based on the weather of the city. There are 4 sets of animations namely:
* RainVideo - Shows rain drops in background when the Main weather is Rain.
* SnowVideo - Shows snowflaskes in background when the Main weather is Snow.
* HazeVideo - Shows fog/haze in background when the Main weather is Haze.
* CloudVideo- Shows clouds in background when the Main weather is Cloudy.

Background Images are generated related to the city as and when found from the internet automatically.
It may ask you for location asccess to show weather of the city you are in.
## Prerequisites/Dependecies
Html,CSS and Javascript knowledge is enough for understanding this project. You will be required to generate an API from OpenWeather Portal using which you will be able to fetch the data.
