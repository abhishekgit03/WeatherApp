# Weather App
Get to know the weather status of any location around the world.

## Description
I have build a dynamic weather website using just HTML,CSS and Javascript where you can search weather status of any city around the world. The results will be shown precisely inside a box that includes fields for:
* Weather(Clouds/Rain/Snow/Mist/Haze)
* Temperature 
* Humidity
* Wind Speed
The application uses OpenWeather API for fetching real time data and insights about the weather of a particular location.
Besides it also shows some animation on the background based on the weather of the city. There are 4 sets of animations namely:
* RainVideo - Shows rain drops in background when the Main weather is Rain.
* SnowVideo - Shows snowflaskes in background when the Main weather is Snow.
* HazeVideo - Shows fog/haze in background when the Main weather is Haze.
* CloudVideo- Shows clouds in background when the Main weather is Cloudy.
